# Making a POST request with Fetch

### Goals

- Execute post requests
- Explain the difference between optimistic and pessimistic rendering
- Explain the difference between each HTTP method

To use the mock-API:
First install JSON Server: `npm install -g json-server`
To start the server run `json-server --watch db.json`
This will produce the following endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/pokemons`


### Deliverables:

1. Make a POST request with values submitted through the form.
2. Render new content on the DOM
